            "* **Gemini 1.5 Pro** is a highly compute-efficient multi-modal mixture-of-experts model that surpasses prior models in a wide range of benchmarks including long-context retrieval tasks, long-document QA, long-video QA, and long-context ASR.\n",
            "* The model can handle extremely long contexts and reason over fine-grained information from up to at least 10M tokens.\n",
            "* Gemini 1.5 Pro greatly surpasses Gemini 1.0 Pro and performs at a similar level to 1.0 Ultra on a wide array of benchmarks while requiring significantly less compute to train. \n",
            "* The model has surprising new capabilities when given a grammar manual for Kalamang, a language with fewer than 200 speakers worldwide; the model learns to translate English to Kalamang at a similar level to a person who learned from the same content. \n",
            "* The model uses a novel mixture-of-experts architecture and major advances in training and serving infrastructure.\n",
            "* Gemini 1.5 Pro maintains high levels of performance across a broad set of benchmarks.\n",
            "* The paper discusses the model's architecture, training, and evaluation, highlighting the novel capabilities of Gemini 1.5 Pro. \n",
